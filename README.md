# Invaders of Space
A game created using python with easygui and pygame modules.

This was a game that i created for my grade 12 final assignment. It uses images from online to act as sprites using the pygame module.

To start, the user is given the instructions as well as the option to start or exit the game

The user can then move around and collect points by shooting down the purple aliens. 
If the alien manages to get past the user, or the alien collides with the user, the user will lose a life

The user may gain lives back by collecting hearts that may periodically fall

If the user loses all their lives, they will be prompted with the choice to restart their game or exit
The users high score will also automatically be locally stored in the "highscore.txt" file.
